    /*  Project: app that calculates bus ticket price based on distance and conditions
         Distance from User (KM), age and trip type (OneDirection, Going&Returning )
         Get seat number information.

         Take the payment as 1 USD / km per distance. (*2 for Going&Returning trip)
         First, calculate the total price of the trip and then apply the following rules to the customer according to the conditions;
         All buses should have a seat number in total "32".
       Values received from the user must be valid (distance and age are positive numbers, trip type is 1 or 2).
        Otherwise, "You Have Entered Wrong Data!" A warning should be given.

       1- If the person has chosen the "Journey Type" Going&Returning trip, 20% discount is applied on the ticket price.
       2-Age discount:
        If the person is younger than 12 years old, 50% discount is applied on the ticket price.
        If the person is between the ages of 12-24, a 10% discount is applied on the ticket price.
        If the person is over 65 years old, a 30% discount is applied on the ticket price.
       3-Single Seat Fee:
        If the seat number is 3 or a multiple of 3, the ticket price is increased by 20%.
